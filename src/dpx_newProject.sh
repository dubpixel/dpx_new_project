# PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
# ================================================================================
#
# This project includes AI-generated code assistance provided by GitHub Copilot.
# 
# GitHub Copilot is an AI programming assistant that helps developers write code
# more efficiently by providing suggestions and completing code patterns.
#
# Ground Rules for AI Assistance:
# - No modifications to working code without explicit request
# - Comprehensive commenting of all code and preservation of existing comments (remove comments that become false/obsolete)
# - Small, incremental changes to maintain code stability
# - Verification before implementation of any suggestions
# - Stay focused on the current task - do not jump ahead or suggest next steps
# - Answer only what is asked, do not anticipate or propose additional work
#
# The AI assistant will follow these directives to ensure code quality,
# maintainability, and collaborative development practices.

# DPX NEW PROJECT CREATOR
# ================================================================================
#
# Script Name: dpx_newProject.sh
# Architect: dubpixel / Joshua Fleitell
# Purpose: Automated project template generator for software and hardware projects
#
# FUNCTIONALITY OVERVIEW:
# 1) Template Copying: Recursively copies the DPX_BLANK_PROJECT_TEMPLATE folder
#    - Includes all files and directories (including hidden files/folders)
#    - Excludes .git folder to avoid version control conflicts
#    - Copies everything that is there except .git folder
#    - Supports both software and hardware project templates
#
# 2) Project Type Selection and File Processing:
#    - Hardware projects: README-hardware_template.md → README.md
#    - Software projects: README-software_template.md → README.md
#    - CHANGELOG-dpx-template.md → CHANGELOG.md (always copied and renamed)
#    - dpx_release_note_template.md → dpx_release_note_template.md (always copied as-is)
#    - LICENSE.txt → LICENSE.txt (always copied as-is)
#    - .gitignore → .gitignore (always copied as-is)
#    - .gitattributes → .gitattributes (always copied as-is)
#    - _config.yml → _config.yml (always copied as-is)
#
# 3) Root Level File Handling:
#    - Only specific files from root are copied (listed above)
#    - All template README variants are excluded from final project
#    - Other root files (like README.md, CHANGELOG.md, etc.) are not copied
#
# 4) Folder Structure Copying:
#    - All folders except .git are copied recursively and untouched
#    - Includes: images/, hardware/, firmware/, ibom/, .github/, .idea/, etc.
#    - No renaming of folders - copied as-is with full contents
#
#    KEY FILES TO COPY AS-IS:
#     - LICENSE.txt
#     - .gitignore
#     - .gitattributes
#     - _config.yml
#     - dpx_release_note_template.md
#
#   FOLDERS TO COPY RECURSIVELY (excluding .git and .idea):
#     - images/ (project images and assets)
#     - hardware/ (3d/, production_files_RTG/, schematic/, spec/, src/)
#     - firmware/ (firmware code structure)
#     - ibom/ (interactive BOM files)
#     - .github/ (GitHub templates and workflows)
#
#     ** Note: All folders copied as-is with full contents, no renaming
#
# 5) String Replacement: Post-copy processing to customize template files
#    - Updates project-specific strings in key files (README.md, etc.)
#    - Replaces placeholder text with actual project information
#    - Ensures project-specific customization after template deployment
#
# TEMPLATE FOLDER ANALYSIS:
# Based on the path structure, the template folder contains:
# 
# KEY FILES TO COPY AND RENAME:
# - README-hardware_template.md (becomes README.md for hardware projects)
# - README-software_template.md (becomes README.md for software projects)
# - CHANGELOG-dpx-template.md (becomes CHANGELOG.md)
#

#
# CHANGE LOG:
# 
# User: "lets now write the script : it takes two arguments to start: first argument is the name of the new project and the second argument is the flag for hardware or software -H or -S - the script should encompas steps 1-4 for now and not step number 5"
#   → Added bash script implementation with argument parsing, path validation, and file copying logic
# 
# User: "ok make it work" (after copy errors for .github files)
#   → Fixed by adding mkdir -p before copying files to ensure parent directories exist
# 
# User: "ok so can u also echo wtf its doing?"
#   → Added detailed echo statements for all operations
# 
# User: "ok edit it to take a third argument -V for that level of verbosity otherwise just echo paths"
#   → Modified to accept 3rd argument -V for verbose mode, otherwise show only paths/steps
# 
# User: "can you actually inlcude verbatim what my prompt was? also lets move that section to around line 91-92 in the code."
#   → Moved change log to line ~91 and added verbatim user prompts
#
# User: "oh i want verbatim user prompts as one line and your solution itemized underneath if ui cam pls pagenate like that would be great thx"
#   → Reformatted change log with user prompts as single lines and solutions itemized underneath
#
# User: "ok so this looks like it works good so far lets put the last step into play -step 5. lets write a separate function to search and replace the string in the README.md file. This is pretty straightforwartd i usually do it manually in sublimetext - basically find and replace all."
#   → Added string replacement function for README.md file using sed to replace placeholder strings
#
# User: "ok so now heres a fun side quest. Take this shell script. leave the directives about how to be a good AI and make a programming file template in the firmware/src directory of te current project were working in?"
#   → Created programming file template with AI directives in firmware/src directory
#
# User: "ok make a variant of that, which is a shell script tamplate."
#   → Created shell script template variant in firmware/src directory
#
# User: "ok so here is a twist on step #5. Id like the project name to always be searched and replaced in all lower case regardless of how its typed in as an argument can u do that?"
#   → Modified string replacement function to convert project name to lowercase before replacement
#
#
# User: "theres also a gemfile that we need to copy. - .ideas should have had files ithem idk what happened to them theyre back now."
#   → Need to add Gemfile to list of root files to copy and verify .idea files are being copied properly
#
# User: "im not even sure we need .idea. i thoght it had to do with something i configured to do with how the githuib pages formatting works"
#   → Added Gemfile to root files copy list, .idea folder may not be necessary (IDE-specific files)
#
# User: "ok lets exclude copying it for now but we can revisit it later"
#   → Modified folder copying to exclude .idea folder (like .git exclusion)
#
# User: "can you init this as a git repo"
#   → Will initialize the dpx_new_project folder as a git repository
#
# User: "ok so here is a twist on step #5. Id like the project name to always be searched and replaced in all lower case regardless of how its typed in as an argument can u do that?"
#   → Modified string replacement function to convert project name to lowercase before replacement
#
# User: "ok so somehwo youre still wokring in the old file can e just consolodate to the one version in one folder please"
#   → Consolidated to work only in dpx_new_project folder going forward
#
# User: "ok lets get rid of old file llease"
#   → Removed old script file from create_new_project_script folder
#
# User: "yep. looks good. lets make another change please. can the program find the template folder to copy based on the new location? can u update the file paths that this is correct and easier depending on hwere i move the template folder?"
#   → Updated path logic to search for template folder relative to script location and handle different locations
#
# User: "ok it needs to create the new project one more folder higher than it did. need to beef up that logic as well. always should be in the folder abouve ...DPX_BLANK etc."
#   → Updated destination directory logic to create projects in the folder above DPX_BLANK_PROJECT_TEMPLATE
#
# User: "can we add some features for the arguments - can they be in any order? also can there be a -M 'messsage goes here' where that message is the sassy tagline ? also want to add a feature where -C ' is the longer comment under about the project' do u understand that and this?"
#   → Added flexible argument parsing with -M for sassy tagline and -C for project description, allowing arguments in any order
#
# User: "yes upldate the string replacement part too please"
#   → Updated string replacement function to replace sassy tagline and project description placeholders in README
#
# User: "ok lets also make a change about folder for the -S flag. with the -S flag we dont care about hardware or firmware. we just care instead about making a folder called src instead."
#   → Modified folder copying logic to exclude hardware and firmware folders for software projects, create src folder instead
#
# User: "well thats close there isnt a src in the priject root - i just want u to make one isntead of coputing hardware and fimrware. does that make more sense>?"
#   → Fixed logic to create src folder instead of copying hardware/firmware folders for software projects
